## Home / Introduction

Hi, my name is **Nazim Hossen**. I am a second year Computer Science student at the **University of Washington Tacoma**. I am interested in AI, cybersecurity, and how technology can be used to solve everyday problems.

This portfolio is a work in progress. As I learn new concepts and complete more projects, I will continue to update this page and my repositories.

**Tagline:**  
> CS student learning to build secure, useful, and simple software.

## About Me

I am currently studying Computer Science at UW Tacoma and working toward the BS track. I enjoy understanding how things work under the hood, which is why I am drawn to programming, problem solving, and systems that connect the digital and physical world.

My goals in the next few years are:

- Strengthen my skills in **Java**, **Python**, and basic **web development**.
- Build small but real projects that I can share with employers and internship programs.
- Explore **cybersecurity** and **software engineering** as possible career paths.

Outside of class, I like working with technology, taking photos and videos, and learning new tools that make work and life more efficient.

## Projects (Work in Progress)

I am at an early stage in my CS journey, so these projects are small and focused on learning fundamentals. I will keep improving them over time.

### 1. Password Strength Checker (Java)

**Overview:**  
A console-based Java program that checks the strength of a password using length, character variety, and common patterns. It gives the user feedback on how to improve their password.

- **Technologies:** Java, basic OOP, conditionals, loops
- **Repository / Demo:** _Coming soon – will be linked here once the repo is public._
- **Key Learnings:** Practiced Java syntax, input handling, and simple security-related logic.

### 2. Personal Portfolio Website (This Site)

**Overview:**  
This portfolio itself is a project using GitHub and GitHub Pages. It is my first step toward building a professional online presence.

- **Technologies:** Markdown, Git, GitHub Pages
- **Repository:** This repository (`nazimhsen31-netizen`)
- **Key Learnings:** Learned how to use version control, manage a repository, and publish content to the web.

### 3. Phishing Awareness Quiz (WIP)

**Overview:**  
A small interactive program that presents sample emails and asks the user to decide whether they are real or phishing. The goal is to help users recognize common red flags.

- **Technologies:** Python (or JavaScript, depending on final version), basic I/O and control flow  
- **Status:** Work in progress  
- **Key Learnings (planned):** Improve user interaction, basic data handling, and input validation.
